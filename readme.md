**PLTR Stock Price vs. Contract Win Announcement** 
By Lisa Cao

*About Dataset*
- The processed Dataset can be found in 'final_output.csv'
- This dataset contains PLTR's historical stock prices PLUS their contracts win. Each row represents each trading day, and if they had been granted any government contract that day, the value of the contract would also be reflected in 'Award Amount.' 


*Purpose of the Dataset*
- This dataset is ideally to be used by investors or stock researches who invest in PLTR and want to know the relationship between Contracts Win vs. Stock Price. 

*Notes about the Dataset*
- Information about government contract is not complete. Due to the short-term nature of the project, I did not get to fix all technical issues, therefore we only have 31 contracts in the dataset. Given more time, I would go ahead and fix the technical issues to include all of PLTR's government-granted contracts.
